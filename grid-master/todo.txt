To Do:

- Add camera to scene and update position when the player is moved upwards 
	on the screen. player dies when they are no longer visible in the 
	viewport

- Set Player position accordingly to how blocks will interact with them

- move block movement logic into Block.gd only if a better relationship can 
	be established between Block.gd and Game.gd

- Add a Grid Query method for finding the closest row, and another
	method for finding the next available open space if a block is 
	blocking the path

- Add a Grid Manipulation method for activating a block upon collision
	with the new block and make the previously static block active again

FORGET THE ABOVE FOR RIGHT NOW
THIS IS WHAT WE WILL DO FOR THIS WEEK:
	I want to use my idea of defining my own coordinate system to be able to create effects such as:
		increasing the size of a range of pixels surrounding a specific pixel 
	I would also like to add multiple layers to the grid so that I can copy and paste between layers
	
	The game that I would like to make will probably be another platformer that showcases the skill 
	of being inventive with what i already have. Im not quite ready to get started on finishing 
	"Fix Your Clothes"
	
	A demonstration of the tech is also good too
	but make you have something fun to play with otherwise people won't care
	You could do a platformer featuring a tilemap that dynamically shrinks and grows depending on 
	where the player is. You won't have to worry much about the design of the game and make a simple 
	game that is similar to a platformer where you can't see anything but here the world just sort 
	of disappears around you instead of there just being a black image with a hole blocking the rest 
	of the screen. It's mostly gimmicky but also a perfect demonstration of the tech in my opinion
